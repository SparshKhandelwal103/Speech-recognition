🎙️ Speech Recognition
A simple yet powerful Speech Recognition system that converts spoken language into written text using machine learning techniques. This project demonstrates the use of modern speech-to-text models for real-time or recorded audio.

📌 Features
Converts speech (live or recorded) into text

Supports multiple audio formats (WAV, MP3, FLAC)

Real-time microphone input transcription

Noise filtering and basic preprocessing

Optional: Keyword spotting / command detection

Export transcriptions to .txt or .json

🧠 Technologies Used
Python 3.8+

SpeechRecognition library

pyaudio / sounddevice for microphone input

transformers (for deep learning models like Whisper or Wav2Vec2)

scipy, librosa for audio processing
